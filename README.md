# Perceptron Example

This is a little GUI tool written for Neural Networks class at Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology.

This tools allows to generate random, linearly separable 2D data-points and then train a simple neuron to classify its 
inputs accordingly. You can also edit the generated points yourself (by double clicking).

The tool allows to train the neuron using following methods:
* simple __perceptron__ learning algorithm
* __ADALINE__ learning algorithm

## Known bugs
The graph library used sometimes causes NPEs when updating existing graphs.
